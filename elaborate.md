Why searching Slack history is not good enough?

SO Teams might help in onboarding new BE devs. There is always somebody leaving and joining.

Some of the Slack exchanges are educational and should be recorded. Idea is that SO Teams with Slack integration can be used for that purpose.

Are Slack searching capabilities good enough? What SO contributes? Linking similar questions and tagging?

SO vs Slack search:
1. SO has tags, related questions, better search

SO - Slack integration is crucial

SO has better text editing capabilities.

SO has better capabilities for discussion.

2 aspects of the knowledgebase to take into account:
1. data entry
2. data retrieval

Issue with searching Slack channels: a lot of discussion naturally happens on private channels, which are not searchable for everybody.

Inefficiency of asking questions on Slack: even if somebody did know the answer to the question 6 months ago, it is very likely that he will have to remind himself thourougly again, which wastes time. Why not store knowledge to some easily accessible knowledge base?
