Why searching Slack history is not good enough?

SO Teams might help in onboarding new BE devs. There is always somebody leaving and joining.

Some of the Slack exchanges are educational and should be recorded. Idea is that SO Teams with Slack integration can be used for that purpose.

Are Slack searching capabilities good enough? What SO contributes? Linking similar questions and tagging?

SO vs Slack search:
1. SO has tags, related questions, better search

SO - Slack integration is crucial

SO has better text editing capabilities.

SO has better capabilities for discussion.

2 aspects of the knowledgebase to take into account:
1. data entry
2. data retrieval

Issue with searching Slack channels: a lot of discussion naturally happens on private channels, which are not searchable for everybody.

Inefficiency of asking questions on Slack: even if somebody did know the answer to the question 6 months ago, it is very likely that he will have to remind himself thourougly again, which wastes time. Why not store knowledge to some easily accessible knowledge base?

Slack + Stack Overflow for Teams -> https://stackoverflow.com/teams/integrations/slack

Examine utility of SO for teams in the context of bugmastering.

From https://stackoverflow.com/teams?utm_source=so-owned&utm_medium=house-ads&utm_campaign=so4b-launch&utm_content=lb-2:  
*1. Unlock knowledge*  
Your team has knowledge buried in old docs, emails, chat messages—and in people’s heads. Stack Overflow gives your team a private, secure home for questions and answers, reducing siloed knowledge and the time it takes to find the right information.

*2. Free up resources*  
It’s expensive and time-consuming to answer the same questions over and over. By making the right information searchable, your private Stack Overflow community serves as the centralized source-of-truth, allowing your entire team to focus on building better software.

*3. Onboard faster*  
A challenge for teams of all sizes is ramping up new coworkers fast without taking up too much of everyone’s time. Give the newest members of your team instant access to everything they need to know in your private Stack Overflow community.

SO Teams site explains what the sw is about nicely. The question is whether this addresses oradian's needs.

SO Teams can also become stale. Yes, but you can ask a question, in the context of existing thread of discussion.  

SO Teams might replace notes devs make for themselves individually.
